== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between this and Pluginception? =

Pluginception is a great plugin to quickly add small snippets to your site as separate modular plugins. Plugin Jump Starter is designed to get you started with full plugins with options and such.

= Why doesn't Otto just do this with Pluginception? =

He may some day, but I have a feeling that this just is not what Pluginception is supposed to be and they have two separate purposes.
